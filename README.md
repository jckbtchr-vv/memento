# Memento 📝💝

**A digital time capsule for parents to create lasting memories for their children.**

Memento allows parents to write notes, capture moments, and create messages that their children can access in the future. Think of it as a digital diary that bridges generations - preserving precious memories, life lessons, and love letters that kids can discover as they grow up.

## ✨ Vision & Features

### Core Concept
- **Multi-child support**: Create separate memory collections for each child
- **Time-release notes**: Schedule messages to be revealed at specific ages or life milestones
- **Rich memories**: Support for text, photos, videos, and voice recordings
- **Timeline view**: Chronological organization of memories and milestones
- **Privacy & security**: Notes remain private until their intended release date
- **Family collaboration**: Allow multiple family members to contribute
- **Export & backup**: Ensure memories are never lost

### Product Potential
This addresses a real emotional need - parents want to share wisdom, capture fleeting moments, and create something meaningful for their children's future. The time-release aspect adds anticipation and discovery, making it special for kids as they grow.
